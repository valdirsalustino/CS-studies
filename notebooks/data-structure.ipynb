    "* A dynamic set that supports these operations is called a dictionary: \n",
    "    * delete;\n",
    "    * insert; \n",
    "    * access;\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements of a dynamic set\n",
    "* Elements of a dynamic set\n",
    "    * In a typical implementation of a dynamic set, each element is represented by an object whose fields can be examined and manipulated if we have a pointer to the object.\n",
    "    * Some kinds of dynamic sets assume that one of the objectâ€™s fields is an identifying key field.\n",
    "    * A totally ordered set satisfies the trichotomy property.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Operations on dynamic sets\n",
    "\n",
    "* **queries**, which simply return information about the set,\n",
    "* **modifying operations**, which change the set. Here is a list of typical operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `SEARCH(S, k)`: \n",
    "\n",
    "        * A query that, given a set `S` and a key value `k`, returns a pointer `x` to an element in `S` such that `key[x] = k`, or `NIL` if no such element belongs to `S`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `INSERT(S, x)`: \n",
    "        * A modifying operation that augments the set `S` with the element pointed to by `x`. We usually assume that any fields in element `x` needed by the set implementation have already been initialized.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * `DELETE(S, x)`: \n",
    "        * A modifying operation that, given a pointer `x` to an element in the set S, removes `x` from `S`. (Note that this operation uses a pointer to an element `x`, not a key value.)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * `MINIMUM(S)`: \n",
    "        * A query on a totally ordered set `S` that returns a pointer to the element of `S` with the smallest `key`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * `MAXIMUM(S)`: \n",
    "        * A query on a totally ordered set `S` that returns a pointer to the element of `S` with the largest `key`.\n",
    "         \n",
    "    * `SUCCESSOR(S, x)`: \n",
    "        * A query that, given an element `x` whose key is from a totally ordered set `S`, returns a pointer to the next larger element in `S`, or `NIL` if `x` is the maximum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `PREDECESSOR(S, x)`: \n",
    "        * A query that, given an element `x` whose key is from a totally ordered set `S`, returns a pointer to the next smaller element in `S`, or NIL if `x` is the minimum element.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `INSERT` operation on a stack is often called `PUSH`, and the `DELETE` operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called `POP`. These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When `top[S] = 0`, the stack contains no elements and is empty. The stack can be tested for emptiness by the query operation `STACK-EMPTY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an empty stack is popped, we say the **stack underflows**, which is normally an error. If `top[S]` exceeds `n`, the **stack overflows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack operations can each be implemented with a few lines of code."

    "The `FIFO` property of a queue causes it to operate like a line of people in the registrar's office. The queue has a **head** and a **tail**. When an element is `enqueued`, it takes its place at the tail of the queue, just as a newly arriving student takes a place at the end of the line. The element `dequeued` is always the one at the **head** of the queue, like the student at the head of the line who has waited the longest.
